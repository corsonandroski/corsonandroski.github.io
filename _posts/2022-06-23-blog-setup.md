## Blog Setup and Introduction

Sharing publicly about your development process is an excellent way to reinforce learning, get feedback, and offer something back to the communities you're learning. Now that I have a solid direction in my career search, and a few ideas for personal projects, I decided to put together a quick jekyll blog on github pages to document the process.

### Where I'm at now

I've been working or playing with tech all my life, from programming flash games as a kid to working as a full stack developer at a small analytics software company. The last couple of years I've been doing tech consulting in the arts, helping artists and curators create everything from individual works to large-scale exhibitions. I've acted as a collaborating artist, curator, designer, and software engineer building virtual environments for remote collaboration in Unity using C#.

I've loved this work, but since my main contracting museum closed for renovations, I've decided to seek out a full time job. While the precarity of contract work is a factor, I'm most excited about finding a long-term position where I can build strong relationships with a team and focus on mastering a tech stack instead of juggling several for differnt contracts.

I'm confident in my skillset as a comunicator and problem solver, and have a great track record learning and adapting to new tech and working environments. I've been an outstanding contributor to every team I've worked on, and I know I'd be valuable at the companies I see hiring now. The challenge is proving that to them, and I think building portfolio projects while learning in-demand skills is a great way to do so.

I've spent the last couple of months interviewing to see what kind of offers I can get currently, learn what's in demand, and get feedback on how I can become the best candidate possible. After turning down an offer today, I've decided I want to compete for better positions, and my job search has helped me develop a plan to do so.

Skills I want to better demonstrate:
- .NET web development
- SQL
- Front end JS framework

### Project Ideas

To develop these skills and build something to show off, I have a couple project ideas:

- Speedrun world record history charting app
- Inland kayaking mapping and weather app

Next up on the blog I'll detail these projects further, choose one, and document its development.
